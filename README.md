# QuirkyCMD

Recently QuirkyCMD was bought by a guy called Cynatica and Eli is not the owner of it anymore.
The new owner 'Cynatica' also is a skid and isn't right mentally in the head and decided to leak a persons IP randomly

Here is proof of said IP leaks: (Obviously everything is censored and thx @Mp3Alt)

Even when confronted he doesn't even try to deny it

I strongly suggest you don't use the 'offical' QuirkyCMD as it ip logs
The one here on this repository is logger free i obviously wont update it though.
